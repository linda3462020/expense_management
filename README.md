# Building an Automated Expense Management App with AI
During spring break, I used the AI tool Bolt to create a web app for managing expenses and budgets: ccku-expense-app.netlify.app. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of turning ideas into actionable solutions. Feel free to try it out or visit my GitHub for sample files, and share with me if find hidden bugs!

## Situation: Solving Expense Management Pain Points
As an international student, I manage all my living expenses independently. Using Excel to track spending, control budgets, and adjust future allocations is easy to get wrong. I wanted to automate this process for efficiency and clarity.

## Mission: Building a Practical Solution
My goal is to develop an app that could:
1. Automatically organize monthly expenses
2. Show budget-to-expense ratios
3. Calculate remaining funds
4. Dynamically adjust future budgets

## Action: Agile Development in Three Steps
- Define Requirements: Identify core functionalities.
- System Implementation: Build logical calculations.
- Interface Optimization: Enhance user experience.
Through iterative testing and adjustments, I completed the app’s core functionality in 10 days, 30 mins each.

## Outcome: Growth Through the Process
This project taught me:
- Debugging and optimization for better performance
- Detailed testing
- Communicating effectively with AI tools to translate needs into executable instructions
The app now supports key features like pie charts for expense categories and budget water level map. While bugs remain (e.g., cross-year data handling), it meets my needs effectively.

## Key Takeaway: Communication Is the Key
The most valuable lesson: Communicating with AI tools is similar to cross-departmental collaboration. I must clearly express my needs in a way others—or systems—can understand. This skill is essential not just for app development but for any collaborative environment.

Agile methodology also reinforced the importance of flexibility and iteration. Each test and feedback cycle brought me closer to a solution aligned with real-world use cases.

Try out the app, and let’s find those hidden bugs together!
